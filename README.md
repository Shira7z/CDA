Confident Pseudo-labeled Diffusion Augmentation for Canine Cardiomegaly Detection

Canine cardiomegaly, characterized by an enlarged heart, poses significant health risks if undetected, necessitating precise and efficient diagnostic methods. Existing models for canine cardiomegaly detection often suffer from limitations such as their reliance on small, poorly annotated datasets and their inability to generalize well across diverse imaging conditions. These challenges hinder their performance and accuracy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we develop a Confident Pseudo-labeled Diffusion Augmentation model (CDA) for canine cardiomegaly identification. We first address the challenges of limited high-quality training data by employing innovative approaches: generating synthetic X-ray images using diffusion models and labeling the key points of Vertebral heart score scores to augment the training dataset. We then applied a pseudo-labeling strategy with Monte Carlo Dropout to select high-confidence labels to further enhance accuracy. These high-confidence labels can help us identify the high-quality labels from the generated synthetic images. By incorporating high-confidence outputs into the training set, we iteratively boost the model's performance, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches.
The combined methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to traditional models, demonstrating its effectiveness. Experimental results confirm that our proposed CDA model achieves state-of-the-art performance in canine cardiomegaly identification.
